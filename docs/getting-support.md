# Getting Support

At Nuvalaw, we are committed to providing timely and effective support to all our clients. This guide outlines how to request assistance, what to expect from our support process, and our service level commitments.

## How to Request Support

The fastest way to get help is to send an email to our dedicated support address. This ensures your request is logged, tracked, and assigned to the right person efficiently.

- **Email:** [support@nuvalaw.com](mailto:support@nuvalaw.com)

When you email us, a support ticket is automatically created in our service desk system, and the original email is linked for full context.

### Supported Systems

This support process covers the **Interact** system.

## Our Support Process Explained

We follow a structured process to ensure every issue is handled consistently and professionally.

1. **Ticket Creation & Triage:**  
   Your email automatically creates a ticket with a `Triage` status. Our First-Level Support team continuously monitors this queue for new requests.

2. **Initial Review & Assignment:**  
   A team member conducts an "Initial Review" to understand the issue. The ticket is then assigned to the most appropriate First-Level Support agent, and its status moves to `Unstarted`.

3. **Acknowledgement & Work Begins:**  
   The assigned agent will send you an initial response acknowledging your request. They will gather any additional information needed and, once work begins, will move the ticket to `In Progress`.

4. **Keeping You Informed:**  
   Our team will keep you updated on the ticket's status and provide workarounds where possible.

5. **Resolution & Closure:**  
   - Once a solution is found, the agent will update the ticket to `Resolved` and send you a final comment explaining the fix.  
   - We wait for your "Confirmation received" that the issue is fully resolved before changing the status to `Closed`.  
   - **Please note:** If we don't receive a response from you within 48 hours of resolution, the ticket may be closed automatically.

## Service Levels & Escalation

Our goal is to resolve your issues as quickly as possible. While specific response times are defined in your commercial agreement, we prioritize issues based on their impact.

### Ticket Priorities

Tickets are assigned a priority to ensure critical issues receive immediate attention. The priority can be raised from `Medium` to `High` or `Urgent` to increase visibility and escalate the request.

| Priority   | Description                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Urgent** | A critical system is down, impacting all users. |
| **High**   | A key feature is unavailable or severely degraded. |
| **Medium** | A non-critical feature is impaired or a general query. |

### Escalation Path

If an issue cannot be resolved by our First-Level Support team, it is escalated to a specialized team:

- **Nuvalaw Product Management:** For software bugs and feature requests related to the Interact system. If a bug is confirmed, a ticket will be formally linked to our engineering team's workflow.  
- **Mendix:** For platform-related issues affecting the Interact system.
