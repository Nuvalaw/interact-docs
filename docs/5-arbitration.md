# Arbitration

The Arbitrator sees the case file per product rules and determines the case on the papers or, where required, on the papers and by oral hearing (differs by product and protocol). The award includes outcomes on liability/quantum and costs per product rules. A limited correction window may apply.

## Party Tasks

Parties to the arbitration have only one task, which is download the award and to action any internal follow-ups (payments, notifications, closures).
