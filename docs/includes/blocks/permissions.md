## Roles

- **Team leaders** have all the permissions of claim handlers, plus the ability to:  
  - Reassign claims and tasks to another team in the organisation.  
  - Reassign drafts between team members.  

!!! note
    If a leader reassigns a claim to another team, they cannot return it to the original team unless they are also a leader in the team that was the target of the reassignment.

## Draft Claims

- Drafts are **visible to all team members** to prevent duplicate work.  
- When a draft is created, a task to complete it is automatically assigned to the creator.  
- Only team leaders can reassign drafts to another user.
