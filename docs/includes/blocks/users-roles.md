Interact uses **team structures** to help you manage and resolve claims efficiently.

## Key Principles

- Every user must belong to a team.  
- If someone needs to work alone, they will be placed in a **team of one**.  

Teams can be set up in three ways:

  1. **By claim type** — e.g. an *OIC Quantum* team that receives all OIC Quantum claims.  
  2. **By organisation** — e.g. a *CompanyName Team* that receives all claims involving that company, regardless of claim type.  
  3. **Manual routing** — e.g. a *Triage Team* that receives all claims and redistributes them to other teams.  

!!! note
    You cannot currently combine claim type and organisation routing.

- Teams act like **containers** for claims and their tasks.  
  - A claim must be inside a team before a user can take ownership of a task.  

## Tasks

- **Tasks** are the actions needed to move a claim toward resolution.  
- By default, tasks sit in the **team backlog** until a user claims them with **+ Assign To Me**.  
- Task ownership is temporary:  
  - Users can **unassign** tasks to return them to the backlog.
