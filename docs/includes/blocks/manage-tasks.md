The system helps you track which tasks you are responsible for and when they need to be completed.

## Task Tabs

On the **Tasks** tab of the homepage, you will see four sub-tabs:

- **All** — lists all tasks belonging to your team(s).
- **Assigned To Me** — lists all tasks assigned to you.
- **Due Today** — shows tasks that are due today.  
- **Overdue** — shows tasks that are overdue and still in the grace period.  
- **Escalating Today** — shows tasks that will automatically escalate to the next user or system-defined action within 24 hours.  

When you create a draft claim, a task is automatically created for you. Drafts are given a **two-week completion window**.

## Draft Management

- To delete a draft you no longer wish to complete:  
  1. Open the draft.  
  2. Click the **kebab menu** (three dots) in the top right.  
  3. Select **Delete**.  

!!! Note
    Deletion is final. No record is kept of deleted drafts.

## Assigning and Unassigning Tasks

When a claim is referred to your team, you will see:

- A **grey pipe** next to the task description.  
- A **+ Assign To Me** button on the right.  

Once you click **+ Assign To Me**: 

- The pipe turns **yellow**.  
- Your name appears in a **yellow pill**, confirming ownership.  

To unassign a task:

- Open the claim.  
- Use the **kebab menu** and select **Unassign**.  
- The task will return to the team backlog.

## Task Highlighting

Tasks are color-coded to show urgency:

- **Green** — active and within the normal task period.  
- **Yellow** — due today.  
- **Red** — overdue (in grace period) or escalating today.  
- **Grey** — draft claims.

## Internal vs. External Claims

**Internal claims** show either:

- A team member’s name in a **grey pill** with a grey pipe, or  
- Your name in a **yellow pill** with a yellow pipe if you are the owner.  

**External claims** show an **outlined pill** with the responsible party’s name, such as *Nuvalaw Admin*, *Arbitrator*, or the opposing organisation.
