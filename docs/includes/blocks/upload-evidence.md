Uploaded and system generated documents are stored under the “Documents” tab. Claimants and Defendants will need to navigate here 

!!! Note
    Documents required during upload are defined in the product protocol. In most cases, these are defined non-prescriptively, with the parties called upon to supply any allowed documents upon which they wish to rely arguing their case.

A list of the required and optional documents is shown on the left hand side of your screen and differs by product and by party.

You can upload multiple documents by drag and drop [1] or one by one.

Uploaded documents must be given a type from the Document Type dropdown list [3]. 
If there are required document types, these must be used, as this ensures that you have confirmed upload of those documents required by the protocol.

Tags from a pre-defined list can be applied to documents [4] to give more metadata to your upload. The party who uploaded the document is recorded as well, in this case "Claimant" [5]. To view or delete the document, use the action buttons on the right [6].
