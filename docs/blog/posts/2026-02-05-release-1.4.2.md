## TL;DR

* **Fixed:** Arbitration fields now save correctly.
* **Fixed:** Draft settlement agreements stay private until settlement is confirmed.
* **Improved:** Credit Hire defendants can now indicate areas of dispute for arbitrator.

## Bug Fixes

### Arbitration values now save reliably

Editing the contributory negligence percentage or other arbitration fields could fail to persist after navigation or page refresh. Values now save on field blur and recalculate award deltas immediately.

### Draft settlement agreements stay private

The system was incorrectly temporarily storing draft settlement agreement PDFs when defendants previewed them—making them visible to claimants and arbitrators even if no settlement occurred. Documents are now only created when a settlement is confirmed.

### Document links in request modals now work

Clicking a document link from the Request Information modal opens the correct file.

## New & Updated Features

### Credit Hire Improvements

Several updates to support the Credit Hire Claims (CHC) product:

**Longer text answers.** Text response fields now support up to 1,500 characters (previously 200), allowing defendants to provide detailed explanations for dispute categories. The input now uses a multi-line textarea for better readability.

**Clearer validation.** Error messages now disappear immediately once a question is validly answered, and validation errors are only visible to the current task owner.

**Helper text for defendants.** A new guidance message on the Defendant Review screen clarifies that dispute category selections require substantiating evidence and limit the scope of arbitration.

**New evidence tags.** Added "Bank Statements" and "Credit Hire Agreement" as document tags for better organisation.

**Dynamic settlement fees.** Settlement agreement documents now pull fees from billing configuration rather than using hardcoded values—ensuring the correct £8 fee displays regardless of claim band or value.
