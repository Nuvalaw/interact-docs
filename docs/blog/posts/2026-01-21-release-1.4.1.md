## Bug Fixes

This hotfix resolves a critical issue affecting arbitrator award publication on OIC claims. Tariff values entered in the tariff box were not being included in the general damages total, causing validation failures when arbitrators attempted to complete awards.

The fix ensures all damage components—including tariff amounts—are properly summed when calculating and publishing final award figures.

    ### Root Cause

    A data inconsistency was identified where Company Configs for the Tariff Amount HoL did not include a Damage Type. When claims were referred to affected companies, the system pulled incomplete config instead of the Master Config, resulting in HoL items with NULL damage types. This caused incorrect damage totals and blocked arbitrators from completing general damages adjustments.

    ### Remediation Applied

    **Logic Update:** Backend logic updated to ensure Damage Type is explicitly included when creating Company Configs from Master Config.

    **Configuration Sync:** Master Config saved to trigger downstream sync and overwrite broken Company Configs.

    **Data Repair:** Targeted microflow executed to identify existing claim HoL items with NULL damage types, retrieve correct damage type from Master Config, and recalculate damage totals for affected offers.

    **Prevention:** Removed automatic config creation action from company admin config view.

    ### Admin Updates

    No admin changes in this release.

    ### Data Fixes

    Awards affected by this issue prior to the fix may require manual review.

    ### Traceability

    **Bug fixes:** ENG-1170
