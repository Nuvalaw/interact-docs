## New & Updated Features

### Claim Analytics Page

Team leaders now have access to a new 'Claim Analytics' page in their left-hand navigation. This feature provides a comprehensive overview of all claims and their current positions in a single view, enabling better work management and informed decision-making. Reports can be downloaded, and a historical record of previous downloads is maintained for reference.

### Bulk Claim Creation via Excel Upload

We're taking steps toward smoother integration with your claims management system. While a full integration is on the horizon, you can now create multiple claims simultaneously by uploading an Excel file (.xlsx) containing claim details.

When creating a claim with a specific counterparty, you can select if you wish to upload a list of claims in bulk and upload a spreadsheet with claim information.

To download the template, click 'Download Template' and populate the rows. Ideally you would configure your case management system to export these columns in the correct format for the claims you wish to process.

Interact will generate a draft claim for each row in the file, providing you with a list of draft claims to review and process. (This itself can be downloaded as an Excel file.)

![Bulk Upload Success Modal](../../assets/blog/bulk-upload-success-modal.png)

This feature allows you, for example, to efficiently upload and create drafts for all your claims against one counterparty at the start of the week.

### Editable Claim Details in Draft Process

Users can now edit claim details directly from the summary tab while working on draft claims, providing greater flexibility during the claim creation process.
