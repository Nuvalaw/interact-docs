Welcome to the Help Centre for Interact.  

This post introduces **Interact**, Nuvalaw’s newly released online dispute resolution (ODR) platform, and gives an overview of its main features.

### What is Interact?

Interact is a secure, cloud-based platform designed to help insurers, law firms resolve claims more quickly and with less administration.

It provides a structured process for submitting, reviewing, negotiating, and arbitrating claims.

### Key Features

Some of the core features include:

- **Case Management**  
  Track claims from draft through to award, with full visibility of status and responsibilities.  

- **Assignments and Due Dates**  
  Tasks are clearly allocated to individuals or teams, with deadlines and escalation rules to keep cases moving.  

- **Evidence and Document Handling**  
  Upload, view, and manage case documents. Interact integrates with external systems to avoid double data entry.  

- **Messaging and Notifications**  
  Stay updated with in-platform messaging, email alerts, and a complete timeline of case activity.  

- **Arbitration and Awards**  
  Arbitrators can review evidence, make decisions, and publish awards directly in the system. Parties can request corrections if needed.  

- **Integration Options**  
  Connect Interact with your existing claims management system via API or secure file transfer.
