* **New:** Arbitrators can request further information from parties during review.

* **Fixed:** Date and stage filters now respond correctly on Tasks and Claims pages.

## New & Updated Features

### Calderbank Offers (MOJ)

You asked for a way to include improved offers made outside the Stage 2 proceedings. Now you can.

Defendants can upload Calderbank Offers when responding to MOJ claims. The arbitrator can consider these when determining costs, and must request comments from both parties under Rule 8.5 before adjusting any costs order.

### Arbitrator Requests for Information

Arbitrators can now request further information from parties during review on both MOJ and OIC claims. This gives arbitrators flexibility to gather necessary details before making determinations.

### Redesigned Claim Timeline

The claim timeline has been rebuilt with an event-driven architecture. You'll see a clearer view of claim activity including document uploads, stage changes, task completions, and assignment history. Timestamps show relative time for recent events (e.g., "Yesterday", "2w ago") and standard dates for older activity.

Claims created from 29 November onwards display the new timeline, indicated by a "NEW" badge.

### Auto-Selection of Tariffs

Tariffs are now automatically selected based on claim parameters, reducing manual data entry during claim setup.

### Enhanced Search

You can now search claims using date formats (including "/" separators) and month names. Searching "November" returns all claims submitted in that month.

### OIC Protocol Update

The OIC Protocol now includes costs provisions for settlements. The costs schedule reflects the appropriate fee structure when claims resolve through settlement.

### Progress Indicator for Arbitrator Review

A green checkmark now appears in the progress section when the arbitrator completes their review steps.

### Bulk Uploader Tooltip

A tooltip on the bulk claim upload feature now links to documentation for the Excel upload process.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed date and stage filters not responding on Tasks and Claims pages.
* Resolved redirect URI error during sign-out.
* Corrected task display showing wrong task after parties responded to award correction requests.
* Addressed Xero token refresh failures causing invoice delays.
