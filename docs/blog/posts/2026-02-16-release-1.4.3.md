## TL;DR

* **Fixed:** Xero invoice failures caused by token corruption are now blocked and surfaced with admin alerts, rather than failing silently.
* **Fixed:** Claims that completed without generating invoices can now be retried through the system — no manual Xero workaround needed.

## Bug Fixes

* Resolved an issue where a scheduled polling event could corrupt the Xero authentication token, causing subsequent invoice submissions to fail silently. The system now blocks billing when a token refresh fails and notifies superadmins by email.
* Fixed a deployment gap (22 December – 20 January) that caused five claims to complete their workflow without triggering invoice generation.
* The Retry button on Invoice Request History now works for invoices where no prior request was ever made to Xero. Previously, the button required a previous request payload to function and was greyed out for these cases.

    ### Admin Updates

    **Xero Token Refresh Observability**
    Superadmins now receive email alerts when Xero authentication failures occur. Invalid tokens are no longer persisted — the system will block billing and surface the failure rather than silently reusing an expired token.

    **Invoice Retry for Null Requests**
    The Retry button in Invoice Request History now supports cases where no prior submission attempt exists (Request Payload = Null). When clicked, the system constructs a fresh payload from the current claim data and submits to Xero. Where retry is genuinely impossible (e.g. missing critical data), the UI now explains why rather than silently disabling the button.

    ### Data Fixes

    **Missing Invoice Remediation (ENG-1203)**
    A controlled backend action retroactively generates invoices for 5 completed claims affected by the deployment timing issue: 2026-0259, 2026-0254, 2026-0267, 2026-0260, 2026-0252.

    **Legacy Uninvoiced Claims**
    The Retry button fix (ENG-1206) also enables remediation of 4 older uninvoiced claims identified in Deon's October 2025 audit, which were previously unresolvable through the system. These claims — originally surfaced in ENG-989 and ENG-990 — can now be retried without manual Xero intervention.

    ### Immediate Measures

    The scheduled Xero polling event that was causing token corruption has been disabled. Purchase orders are being created manually until a permanent fix is deployed.

    ### Traceability

    **Parent:** ENG-1194

    **Bug fixes:** ENG-1202, ENG-1203, ENG-1204, ENG-1205, ENG-1206

    **Related:** ENG-989, ENG-990, ENG-1195, ENG-1207
