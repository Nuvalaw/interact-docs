## New: Create Drafts from Rejected or Terminated Claims

Rework rejected/terminated claims without starting from scratch. The duplicated draft preserves context and maintains a clean audit trail linking back to the original outcome.

### How to use it

- Go to **Claims** → open the **Completed** tab.
- Use the **Status** filter above the table and choose **Rejected** (or locate **Terminated** claims as applicable).

- Open the claim and select **Duplicate as Draft**.
- Edit the draft as needed and **Resubmit**.

### What you’ll see

The duplicated draft includes a new **origin data card** on the **Claim Summary** showing the original claim reference and outcome. This makes it easy for reviewers to see the link back to the prior decision.

    Permissions and visibility follow your organisation’s standard settings. No special configuration is required.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- General stability, UI polish, and minor workflow fixes to reduce friction during claim review and submission.
- Performance improvements for **Claims** page filters and loading in the **Completed** tab.
