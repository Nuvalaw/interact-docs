## New & Updated Features

### Draft Limitation for Rejected Claims
Following on from last week’s update, users can now create **only one draft** from any rejected claim.  
This ensures that your team’s work remains streamlined and prevents duplicate submissions.

### Permissions Update: Team Leader Access
Team leaders now have permissions to view **Requests for Correction** under the **Outcome** tab in the **Claim Summary**.  
This enhances visibility and control during claim resolution.

### UI Improvements
Minor updates to table layouts across the platform to improve readability and consistency.
