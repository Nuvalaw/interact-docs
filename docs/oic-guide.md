### Summary

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | OIC RTA PI where **injury ≤ £5,000** and **total claim ≤ £10,000**. For complex credit‑hire valuation, use the **Credit Hire** protocol. |
| **Decision** | **Liability**, **Quantum**, or **Both** (paper‑only). |
| **Who** | OIC claims handlers and solicitors who need a fast, enforceable decision when settlement stalls. |
| **When** | After offers have been exchanged and the claim remains in dispute; not suitable where fraud/fundamental dishonesty is alleged. |
| **Uploads** | Court pack and documents already served in the OIC process; clean, legible PDFs only. |
| **Legal context** | Arbitration under the **Arbitration Act 1996** governed by the **law of England & Wales**. |
| **Outcome** | **Final & binding** award; enforceable as a judgment under **s.66 AA 1996**. |
