# Final Review

The Claimant reviews the case as it stands after the Defendant has responded. There are three options available to the Claimant at Final Review.

### Accept & Settle

If the Defendant responded with an offer/positions you can accept as is, click Accept & Settle. The system publishes a Settlement Agreement to the case record and to both parties; the case closes (see next section).

### Send to Arbitrator

If you do not accept and settle, proceed to arbitrator nomination by clicking the arbitration button.

### Conditional Rejection

If the Defendant uploaded Additional evidence in Step 2, a Reject button appears. Use it to reject the claim due to inadmissible evidence per protocol.


!!! Note
    Final Review applies in {{ oic_protocol }} and {{ chc_protocol }} but not in {{ moj_protocol }}. The system condition for 'Reject' = at least one document uploaded by the Defendant during their review is tagged Additional evidence.
