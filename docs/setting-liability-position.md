# Setting Liability Position

## Claimant

A claim is either for quantum, liability, or both. Where a claim is for quantum, the liability has been agreed and must merely be captured. Where liability is in dispute, you will need to set your position.

## Defendant

A claim is either for quantum, liability, or both. Where a claim is for quantum, the liability has been agreed and must merely be captured. Where liability is in dispute, you will need to set your position.

### Review Agreed Liability

In quantum only claims, liability is agreed. You should verify that the liability that has been captured by the claimant at referral is correct and reflects what was agreed between you as this contributory negligence figure will determine the reduction applied to the quantum.

### Liability Offer

In liability or liability and quantum claims, you will need to set your offer on liability in response to the claimant's claim.
