# Base Flow Overview

On Interact, we follow a standard process for all products, with minor deviations.  
If not stated on a product page, assume **Base behaviour**. Durations differ by product. 

| Step                    | Role                     | Actions                                                                                                               | Notes                                                                                                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Refer**               | Claimant                 | Upload evidence and capture/update positions.                                                                        | First step of the flow.                                                                                              |
| **Respond**             | Defendant                | Review claim, optionally upload evidence, capture/update positions.                                                  | Defendant can **Accept & Settle** at this stage, publishing a binding Settlement Agreement.                           |
| **Final Review**        | Claimant                 | Review Defendantâ€™s response. Optionally reject if Defendant uploaded additional evidence.                             | Applies in OIC and Credit Hire (always has Final Review). <br> **MoJ is two-step only** (no Final Review).             |
| **Accept & Settle**     | Defendant or Claimant    | Accept the claim as it stands, without countering.                                                                   | Publishes a Settlement Agreement and ends the process. Binding like an arbitral award.                                |
| **Arbitration**         | Arbitrator               | Arbitrator decides the case on the papers and issues an award with reasons and costs.                                  | Product-dependent. Limited correction window applies.                                                               |

!!! Note
    If the Defendant chooses to reject the claim upon receipt of the referral, a certificate of case status is published to the case record which the claimant may use in court as evidence of their attempt to arbitrate. This certificate contains the defendant's response and rejection reasons.
