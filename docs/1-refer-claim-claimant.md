# Referring a Claim for Arbitration

Capture Claim Information
Once the draft claim is created, a task to complete the draft will automatically be assigned to you. When a task is assigned to you, your name is highlighted in yellow within a pill. So long as your name appears in yellow, you are the task owner. 

(Other colours are used to mean different things. See "Platform Navigation" for more details on how colour is used on Interact.
You will also notice yellow dots on the top right hand corner of the “Documents” and “Position” tabs indicating that your attention is required. 
Upload Documents
Under the “Documents” tab, upload the required and any optional documents in support of the claim. These differ per protocol. You can upload multiple documents by drag and drop [1] or one by one. A list of the required and optional documents is shown on the left hand side of your screen. 

Your uploaded document must be given a type from the Document Type dropdown list [3] and the required upload document types must be used in order to refer the claim. This is to ensure that you proactively confirm you have uploaded those documents required by the process.
You can optionally add tags [4] from a pre-defined list to give more metadata to your upload. The party who uploaded the document is recorded as well, in this case "Claimant" [5]. To view or delete the document, use the action buttons on the right [6].

Having uploaded your documents, click the blue action button on the bottom right of your screen labeled “Next: Position” to continue.
Add Position
The position you capture here should be your final offer, which will typically be your last portal offer.

To continue the referral steps, select the specific claim type from the article list on the left hand panel. {{ oic_protocol }}.
